	<p>Using the UP and DOWN keys guide Running Guy across the screen as you dodge the Randomly Generated obstacles (city buildings). There are different levels of the Cloud Kingdom and when Running Guy enters these new levels he must fly faster. Running Guy is not the toughest guy around so if he ever crashes into a city building he must recover and start all the way back to the beginning. See how far through Cloud Kingdom you can get before you crash Running Guy into a building! </p>
